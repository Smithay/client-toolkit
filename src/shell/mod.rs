//! # Shell abstractions
//!
//! A shell describes a set of wayland protocol extensions which define the capabilities of a surface and how
//! the surface is displayed.
//!
//! ## Cross desktop group (XDG) shell
//!
//! The XDG shell describes the semantics of desktop application windows.
//!
//! The XDG shell defines two types of surfaces:
//! - [`Window`] - An application window[^window].
//! - [`Popup`] - A child surface positioned relative to a window.
//!
//! ### Why use the XDG shell
//!
//! The XDG shell is the primary protocol through which application windows are created. You can be near
//! certain every desktop compositor will implement this shell so that applications may create windows.
//!
//! See the [XDG shell module documentation] for more information about creating application windows.
//!
//! ## Layer shell
//!
//! The layer shell is a protocol which allows the creation of "layers". A layer refers to a surface rendered
//! at some specific z-depth relative to other layers. A layer may also be anchored to some edge and corner of
//! the screen.
//!
//! The layer shell defines one type of surface: the [`wlr_layer::LayerSurface`].
//!
//! There is no guarantee that the layer shell will be available in every compositor.
//!
//! ### Why use the layer shell
//!
//! The layer shell may be used to implement many desktop shell components, such as backgrounds, docks and
//! launchers.
//! 
//! ## Wl shell
//! 
//! The Wl shell is a deprecated protocol which is like xdg shell but less functional.
//! 
//! ### Why use the Wl shell
//! 
//! The Wl shell uses like xdg shell for application windows creation.
//! It's deprecated, so it uses only in some legacy projects like Sailfish OS.
//!
//! [^window]: The XDG shell protocol actually refers to a window as a toplevel surface, but we use the more
//! familiar term "window" for the sake of clarity.
//!
//! [XDG shell module documentation]: self::xdg
//! [`Window`]: self::xdg::window::Window
//! [`Popup`]: self::xdg::popup::Popup
//!
//! [`Layer`]: self::layer::LayerSurface
