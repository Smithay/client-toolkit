 color on the buttons to be customized beyond what the secondary color allows.
 Button color methods now affect the `ConceptFrame`'s fill behind the buttons.
- Fix the firing of `Configure` events in window abstraction.

## 0.4.1 -- 2018-11-06

- Window: always request server-side decorations if available, otherwise ther compositor never configures us
